Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was the client, the objective was to create a resource that people could use in order to study, test an dschedual driving appointments, the system would allow the user to make changes and address the instructor and they also could interact with each otehr as needed. The system would update in accordance with the DMV and always maintain up to date information. The system would allow the admin to add featers and packages and take them away as needed.

What did you do particularly well?
The writing portion is my best stregth, knowing what to write and what is needed. In this case though, the projects seemed very repetative.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The UML diagrams would be the main thing I would fix. They are fairly sloppy in their own way, granted they are to my ability but if given more time (my schedual) and maybe someone aside me to question what im doing and what I'm missing would have really helped. Feeling like your alone and kind of in the dark leaves me to never feel like I know for certain I am submitting the right things. Thi worst part was always the lucid.app. It would crash and give me serious issues and lose my work causing me to have to rush and finish what I could. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read through their transcript and honestly struggled at first really lining everything up, it started out with confidence issues and then progressed into better understanding. There where a lot of broad things like security and design that kind of left something up to me to figure out and thats what I did. If lucid charts did crash every time and make me rush a genaric product I think we would have seen really how well I intrepreted everything and really how good I am.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Read the information as carful as possible, take note of the more impratant things and really try to sullitify what is really neeeded and wher I should begin my work. As someone who is knew, I knoew that I never get it right the first time but I do relay on good quality research and advice. When I am working woth software design, my first priority is orginizing the structure that makes sense, collaborating that with someone of knowledge and talent and correcting the order of operations that I write down, Then I go and attack the procress with the person that is mor knowledge able. My goal is one day be the person that otehr collaborate with to make improvments.
